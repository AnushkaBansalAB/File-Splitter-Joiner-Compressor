# File-Splitter-Joiner-Compressor

Sometimes, there is traffic in data which can lead to rejection of forwarding the file. And the same network error(traffic) can happen on the receiver site joiner.Sometimes, there are larger files having many mbâ€™s of size which will take larger space in disk memory.

This project will help to reduce the disk space by compression. Splits a large file into smaller files of specified bytes and also joins them back to the original file.

It will enable us to split a large file into small chunks which are easy to be sent and stored, while File Joiner allows you to join these split parts together so that the original file is restored. And compression allows you to take many files and compress them into one file, which is smaller than the combined size of the originals to use less disk space.

This project aims to solve the data wastage which occurs if any network error comes during sending or downloading the files and to use less disk space.
